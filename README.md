Tamagotchi
======================================

The project can be run in Java Eclipse by simply downloading the folder and copying the folder's contents into a Java Project (named FinalProject) and configuring the JRE System Library's "Access Rules" with the additional rule: Accessible "javafx/**"

No other changes should be necessary.


The app's functionality is as follows:

The pet's breed can be selected using radio buttons.
The pet's name can be entered in a textfield.
If the pet's name is not entered and the name button is pressed, a prompt will appear to enter a name.
The pet's stats are shown below the pet.
Pressing any of the 3 interaction buttons will affect the pet's stats.
The shop button DOES NOT WORK.  The team member in charge of this scene did not add it.
The game button only leads to a non-interactive scene with a back button.  Another team member did not add any interactivity to this scene.
